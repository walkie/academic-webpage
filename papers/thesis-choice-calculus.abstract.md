In this thesis I present the choice calculus, a formal language for
representing variation in software and other structured artifacts. The choice
calculus is intended to support variation research in a way similar to the
lambda calculus in programming language research. Specifically, it provides a
simple formal basis for presenting, proving, and communicating theoretical
results. It can serve as a common language of discourse for researchers working
on different views of similar problems and provide a shared back end in tools.

This thesis collects a large amount of work on the choice calculus. It defines
the syntax and denotational semantics of the language along with modular
language extensions that add features important to variation research.  It
presents several theoretical results related to the choice calculus, such as an
equivalence relation that supports semantics-preserving transformations of
choice calculus expressions, and a type system for ensuring that an expression
is well formed. It also presents a Haskell DSEL based on the choice calculus
for exploring the concept of variational programming.
