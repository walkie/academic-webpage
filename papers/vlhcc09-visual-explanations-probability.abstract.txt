Continuing our research in explanation-oriented language design, we present a
domain-specific visual language for explaining probabilistic reasoning.
Programs in this language, called explanation objects, can be manipulated
according to a set of laws to automatically generate many equivalent
explanation instances. We argue that this increases the explanatory power of
our language by allowing a user to view a problem from many different
perspectives.
