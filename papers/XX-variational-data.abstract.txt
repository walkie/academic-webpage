Variation is everywhere. Especially in the construction and analysis of
customizable software, there arises a need for correspondingly variational data
structures. So far, variational data structures have been explored and
developed ad-hoc, as required for each individual use case. This perspective
paper is a first attempt and a call to action for more systematic and
foundational research in this area. We describe how support for variation can
be understood as a general and orthogonal property of data types, data
structures, and algorithms. We begin a systematic exploration of basic
variational data structures, exploring the tradeoffs between different
implementations. Finally, we retrospectively analyze the design decisions in
our own previous work where we have independently encountered problems
requiring variational data structures, and in the work of others who needed to
represent and reason about variation.
