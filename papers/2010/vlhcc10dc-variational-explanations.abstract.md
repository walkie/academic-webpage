This work considers the intersection of explanation-oriented language design
and software variation management, two seemingly disparate research areas that
turn out to be quite complementary. Successful explanations are often highly
variable to adapt to the needs of a particular user, but this also makes them
complex and unwieldy unless supported by a sound theory of variation.
