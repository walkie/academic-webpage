Convention dictates that the design of a language begins with its syntax. We
argue that early emphasis should be placed instead on the identification of
general, compositional semantic domains, and that grounding the design process
in semantics leads to languages with more consistent and more extensible
syntax.  We demonstrate this semantics-driven design process through the design
and implementation of a DSL for defining and manipulating calendars, using
Haskell as a metalanguage to support this discussion. We emphasize the
importance of compositionality in semantics-driven language design, and
describe a set of language operators that support an incremental and modular
design process.
