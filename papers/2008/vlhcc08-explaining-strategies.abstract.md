We present a visual language for strategies in game theory, which has potential
applications in economics, social sciences, and in general science education.
This language facilitates explanations of strategies by visually representing
the interaction of players' strategies with game execution. We have utilized
the cognitive dimensions framework in the design phase and recognized the need
for a new cognitive dimension of "traceability" that considers how well a
language can represent the execution of a program. We consider how traceability
interacts with other cognitive dimensions and demonstrate its use in analyzing
existing languages. We conclude that the design of a visual representation for
execution traces should be an integral part of the design of visual languages
because understanding a program is often tightly coupled to its execution.
