Highly configurable software often uses preprocessor annotations to handle variability. However, understanding, maintaining, and evolving code with such annotations is difficult, mainly because a developer has to work with all variants at a time. Dedicated methods and tools that allow working on a subset of all variants could ease the engineering  of highly configurable software. We investigate the potential of one kind of such tools: projection-based variation control systems integrated with projectional editors. For such systems we aim to understand: (i) what end-user operations they need to support, and (ii) whether they can realize the actual evolution of real-world, highly configurable software. We conduct an experiment that investigates variability-related evolution  patterns and that evaluates the feasibility of a projection-based variation control system by replaying parts of the history of a real-world 3D printer firmware project. Among others, we show that the prototype variation control system does indeed support the evolution of a highly configurable system and that in general, it does not degrade the code.
