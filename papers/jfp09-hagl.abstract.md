Experimental game theory is increasingly important for research in many fields.
Unfortunately, it is poorly supported by computer tools. We have created Hagl,
a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell, to reduce the development time
of game-theoretic experiments and make the definition and exploration of games
and strategies simple and fun.
