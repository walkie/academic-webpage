Many areas of computer science are concerned with some form of variation in
software--from managing changes to software over time, to supporting families
of related artifacts. We present the choice calculus, a fundamental
representation for software variation that can serve as a common language of
discourse for variation research, filling a role similar to the lambda calculus
in programming language research. We also develop an associated theory of
software variation, including sound transformations of variation artifacts, the
definition of strategic normal forms, and a design theory for variation
structures, which will support the development of better algorithms and
tools.
