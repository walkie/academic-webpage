We present an explanation-oriented, domain-specific, visual language for
explaining probabilistic reasoning. Explanation-oriented programming is a new
paradigm that shifts the focus of programming from the computation of results
to explanations of how those results were computed. Programs in this language
therefore describe explanations of probabilistic reasoning problems. The
language relies on a storytelling metaphor of explanation, where the reader is
guided through a series of well-understood steps from some initial state to the
final result. Programs can also be manipulated according to a set of laws to
automatically generate equivalent explanations from one explanation instance.
This increases the explanatory value of the language by allowing readers to
cheaply derive alternative explanations if they do not understand the first.
The language is comprised of two parts: a formal textual notation for
specifying explanation-producing programs and the more elaborate visual
notation for presenting those explanations. We formally define the abstract
syntax of explanations and define the semantics of the textual notation in
terms of the explanations that are produced.
