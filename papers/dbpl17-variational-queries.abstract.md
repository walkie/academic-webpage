Users of relational database systems leverage the schema of the database to express their queries precisely. However, the schema of a database often evolves due to changes in the domain of interest or the application requirements, or in order to improve performance and usability. Unfortunately, often there is no documentation of the mapping between the original and the evolved schemas. Hence, users have to spend a great deal of time and resources to find queries written over the original schema that may break or do not return the desired information, then translate them to semantically equivalent queries over the evolved schema. In this paper, we outline our proposal to reduce the amount of work for maintaining queries in the face of changes to the schema of the database. We introduce the concept of *variational queries*, which is a compact and structured encoding of all possible translations of a query over a set of (common) schematic variations. Given a query over a schema, our system will create its corresponding variational query. After each schema modification, the system provides the user with a list of promising translations that match the current schema. Using a compact and structured representation, this approach clearly isolates the parts of the query that may need to be modified, helping users save their time and effort in maintaining queries.
