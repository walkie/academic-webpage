We present a formal calculus for modeling and implementing variation in
software. It unifies the compositional and annotative approaches to feature
implementation and supports the development of abstractions that can be used to
directly relate feature models to their implementation. Since the compositional
and annotative approaches are complementary, the calculus enables implementers
to use the best combination of tools for the job and focus on inherent feature
interactions, rather than those introduced by biases in the representation. The
calculus also supports the abstraction of recurring variational patterns and
provides a metaprogramming platform for organizing variation in artifacts.
