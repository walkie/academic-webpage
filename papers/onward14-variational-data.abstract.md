Variation is everywhere, but in the construction and analysis of customizable
software it is paramount. In this context, there arises a need for variational
data structures for efficiently representing and computing with related
variants of an underlying data type. So far, variational data structures have
been explored and developed ad hoc. This paper is a first attempt and a call to
action for systematic and foundational research in this area. Research on
variational data structures will benefit not only customizable software, but
the many other application domains that must cope with variability. In this
paper, we show how support for variation can be understood as a general and
orthogonal property of data types, data structures, and algorithms. We begin a
systematic exploration of basic variational data structures, exploring the
tradeoffs between different implementations. Finally, we retrospectively
analyze the design decisions in our own previous work where we have
independently encountered problems requiring variational data structures.
