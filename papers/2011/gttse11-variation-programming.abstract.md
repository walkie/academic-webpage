The choice calculus provides a language for representing and transforming
variation in software and other structured documents. Variability is captured
in localized choices between alternatives. The space of all variations is
organized by dimensions, which provide scoping and structure to choices. The
variation space can be reduced through a process of selection, which eliminates
a dimension and resolves all of its associated choices by replacing each with
one of their alternatives. The choice calculus also allows the definition of
arbitrary functions for the flexible construction and transformation of all
kinds of variation structures. In this tutorial we will first present the
motivation, general ideas, and principles that underlie the choice calculus.
This is followed by a closer look at the semantics. We will then present
practical applications based on several small example scenarios and consider
the concepts of "variation programming" and "variation querying". The
practical applications involve work with a Haskell library that supports
variation programming and experimentation with the choice calculus.
