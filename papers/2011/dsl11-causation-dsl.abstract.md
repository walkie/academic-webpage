We present a domain-specific embedded language (DSEL) in Haskell that supports
the philosophical study and practical explanation of causation. The language
provides constructs for modeling situations comprised of events and functions
for reliably determining the complex causal relationships that emerge between
these events. It enables the creation of visual explanations of these causal
relationships and a means to systematically generate alternative, related
scenarios, along with corresponding outcomes and causes. The DSEL is based on
neuron diagrams, a visual notation that is well established in practice and has
been successfully employed for causation explanation and research. In addition
to its immediate applicability by users of neuron diagrams, the DSEL is
extensible, allowing causation experts to extend the notation to introduce
special-purpose causation constructs. The DSEL also extends the notation of
neuron diagrams to operate over non-boolean values, improving its
expressiveness and offering new possibilities for causation research and its
applications.
