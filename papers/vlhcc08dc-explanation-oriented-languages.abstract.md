We are developing a new paradigm of explanation-oriented languages whose
objective is not only to describe the computation of values, but also to
provide explanations of how and why those values are obtained. We have begun
exploring this approach in the design of a visual notation for strategies in
game theory. We plan to apply these ideas to other domains of public interest
to both benefit those domains and to expand and solidify the theory behind
explanation-oriented design.
