Humans play an active role in the execution of certain kinds of programs, such
as spreadsheets, workflows and interactive notebooks. Interacting closely with
execution is especially useful when end-users are learning from examples while
doing their work. In order to better understand the language features needed to
support this kind of use, we investigated a particularly rigid and formalized
category of "program" people write for each other: lab protocols. These
protocols present a linear, idealized process despite the complex contingencies
of the lab work they describe. However, they employ a variety of techniques for
limiting or expanding the semantic interpretation of individual steps and for
integrating outside protocols. We use these observations to derive implications
for the design of interactive and mixed-initiative programming languages.
