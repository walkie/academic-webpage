In the context of software product lines, there is often a need to represent
graphs containing variability. For example, extending traditional modeling
techniques or program analyses to variational software requires a corresponding
notion of variational graphs. In this paper, we introduce a general model of
variational graphs and a theoretical framework for discussing variational graph
algorithms. Specifically, we present an abstract syntax based on tagging for
succinctly representing variational graphs and other data types relevant to
variational graph algorithms, such as variational sets and paths. We
demonstrate how (non-variational) graph algorithms can be generalized to
operate on variational graphs, to accept variational inputs, and produce
variational outputs. Finally, we discuss a filtering operation on variational
graphs and how this interacts with variational graph algorithms.
