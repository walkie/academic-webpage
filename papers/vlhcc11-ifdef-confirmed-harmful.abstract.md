Maintaining variation in software is a difficult problem that poses serious
challenges for the understanding and editing of software artifacts. Although
the C preprocessor (CPP) is often the default tool used to introduce
variability to software, because of its simplicity and flexibility, it is
infamous for its obtrusive syntax and has been blamed for reducing the
comprehensibility and maintainability of software. In this paper, we address
this problem by developing a prototype for managing software variation at the
source code level. We evaluate the difference between our prototype and CPP
with a user study, which indicates that the prototype helps users reason about
variational code faster and more accurately than CPP. Our results also support
the research of others, providing evidence for the effectiveness of related
tools, such as CIDE and FeatureCommander.
