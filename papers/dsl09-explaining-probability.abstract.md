We propose a new focus in language design where languages provide constructs
that not only describe the computation of results, but also produce
explanations of how and why those results were obtained. We posit that if users
are to understand computations produced by a language, that language should
provide explanations to the user.  As an example of such an
explanation-oriented language we present a domain-specific language for
explaining probabilistic reasoning, a domain that is not well understood by
non-experts. We show the design of the DSL in several steps. Based on a
story-telling metaphor of explanations, we identify generic constructs for
building stories out of events, and obtaining explanations by applying stories
to specific examples. These generic constructs are then adapted to the
particular explanation domain of probabilistic reasoning. Finally, we develop a
visual notation for explaining probabilistic reasoning.
