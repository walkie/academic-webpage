Here are my current students:

**Lambda Reading Group:** We're a group of programming languages students and
faculty that meets to discuss a different paper each week. If you're interested
in programming languages, you're welcome to join. We coordinate by email, so
drop me a line if you want to attend so you can read the paper ahead of time.

Current weekly meeting times:

 * Research talks: **Monday 1-2pm**
 * Reading group: **Wednesday 2-3pm**
