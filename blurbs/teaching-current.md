**[CS 609 Discussion Seminar: Modular Extensibility](/teaching/cs609-su14/)**
    
A property of good software is the ability to add new features in a modular
way. Many programming languages provide good support for some kinds of modular
extensions but not others. For example, in most object-oriented programs it is
trivial to add new kinds of objects, but adding new operations on existing
objects is not modular since we must edit existing class definitions.
Conversely, in most functional programs it is easy to add new functions, but
adding new kinds of objects is hard since we must edit the data type
definitions. The challenge of supporting all kinds of modular extensions has
been called the "expression problem". In this seminar we will study modular
extensibility, focusing especially on the design patterns and language features
that address the expression problem.
