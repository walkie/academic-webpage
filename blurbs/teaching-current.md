**[CS 583 Functional Programming](teaching/cs583-fa14)** (Fall 2014)

An introduction to advanced functional programming features and techniques,
using [Haskell](http://haskell.org). The course will begin with an accelerated
introduction to Haskell, so no prior experience is necessary. However, students
new to functional programming may need to invest some extra effort in the first
few weeks. We will focus especially on producing elegant functional programs,
and use [peer-critiquing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_critique)
throughout the course.
