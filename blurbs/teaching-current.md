**Upcoming course:** Most programming language research focuses on formal and
machine-centric qualities of languages, but programming languages are
ultimately for *people*. How can we design good languages that help us solve
harder problems and make computing more accessible?

This winter semester at Marburg I will be leading the discussion seminar
**CS609: Human Factors in Programming Languages**. Please read the course
description on my [teaching page](/teaching.html) and sign up!
