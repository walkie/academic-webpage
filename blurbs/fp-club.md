title: Functional Programming Club
---

I am the faculty advisor for the [OSU Functional Programming Club][FPC].

This is a student-run, official OSU club for students (graduate and
undergraduate) who are interested in functional programming. The club meets
weekly to learn, discuss, and explore functional programming together, and to
hopefully build cool things in the process. All skill levels are welcome.

Here's another [link to the webpage][FPC], where you can find information on
the mailing list, meeting times, current projects, and more!
