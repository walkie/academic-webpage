title: Lambda Reading Group
---

I am founder and co-advisor (with [Martin Erwig][Martin]) of this informal
group of students and faculty that meets weekly to discuss a different research
paper on programming languages. Most of the participants are programming
languages graduate students, but we are also regularly joined by students from
the theory and software engineering groups, by advanced undergraduate students,
and last summer, even by a local high school student.

If you're interested in programming languages, you're welcome to join too! Just
send me an email so we know to expect you and so I can send you the paper to
read in advance.

Current weekly meeting time (Spring 2020): **Friday 1pm, Zoom**

<!-- 
 * Research talks: **Tuesday 2-3pm** (KEC 3057)
