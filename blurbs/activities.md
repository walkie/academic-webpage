**[Domain-Specific Language Design and Implementation (DSLDI'16)][DSLDI16]**
<br>
I am organizer and co-chair of this year's DSLDI workshop, co-located with
[SPLASH 2016](http://2016.splashcon.org/) in Amsterdam (Oct 30--Nov 4). Please
consider submitting a short talk proposal! A special goal of this year's
workshop is to encourage participation from *end-user programming* and *human
factors* of programming languages researchers.

I am also serving, or have recently served, on the program committees for:

 * [SLE 2016][SLE16]
 * [VL/HCC 2016][VLHCC16]
 * [PEPM 2016][PEPM16]
 * [VL/HCC 2015][VLHCC15] (also showpieces co-chair, and on the grad consortium committee)
 * [VaMoS 2015][VaMoS15]
