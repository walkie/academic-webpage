I am an organizer and activist for the [United Academics of Oregon State
University](http://uaosu.org). If you have any questions about our new faculty
union here at OSU, please shoot me an email. I'd love to talk!

Recently, I organized and chaired the graduate consortium at [VL/HCC
2017][VLHCC17], and organized and co-chaired several workshops: [FOSD
2017][FOSD17], [DSLDI 2017][DSLDI17], and [DSLDI 2016][DSLDI16]. I was also the
web and publicity co-chair for [SPLASH 2017](http://2017.splashcon.org).

I am also serving or have recently served on the program committees for:

 * [SLE 2018][SLE18]
 * [GPCE 2017][GPCE17]
 * [SLE 2017][SLE17]
 * [VL/HCC 2017][VLHCC17]
 * [SLE 2016][SLE16]
 * [VL/HCC 2016][VLHCC16]
 * [PEPM 2016][PEPM16]
