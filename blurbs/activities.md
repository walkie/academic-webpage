I am the organizer and co-chair of this year's [Feature-Oriented Software
Development (FOSD 2017) workshop][FOSD17], and co-chair of this year's
[Domain-Specific Language Design and Implementation (DSLDI 2017)
workshop][DSLDI17]. Both workshops will be co-located with [SPLASH
2017](http://2017.splashcon.org) in Vancouver, Canada.

I am also the web and publicity co-chair of SPLASH 2017, so expect lots of spam
from me this year. :-)

Last year, I organized and co-chaired [DSLDI 2016][DSLDI16]. Thanks to everyone
who participated!
