**NOTE:** I had a catastrophic email forwarding error between Dec 18, 2015 and
Jan 5, 2016 affecting the email address listed above. Unfortunately, I was slow
to detect this due to the holidays and since many of my colleagues and students
still use my old @eecs account, which was forwarding correctly.

If you sent me an email during this time that I did not reply to, please
re-send it. I apologize for the inconvenience.
