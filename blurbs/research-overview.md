title: Research Overview
---

My research is broadly focused on *language design* and *domain-specific
languages*. I believe that clear and expressive languages are essential for
understanding, solving, and explaining difficult problems. I am especially
interested in type systems, [functional programming][Haskell], and modularity.

Currently, I am researching formal representations and analyses of *variation*.
I am the co-creator of the [*choice calculus*][CC], a simple calculus of
variation that can be easily extended with new features and instantiated by new
object languages. This research was originally motived by improving the
development and maintenance of massively configurable software, such as
[software product lines][SPL]. However, it has since been applied to modeling
resource consumption, optimizing gradually typed programs, typing generalized
algebraic data types, and more.
