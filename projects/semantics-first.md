# Semantics First Language Design

By convention, the design of a language begins by defining its syntax based on
the use cases the designer anticipates. Once the syntax is established, it is
given meaning by defining (or usually, implementing) a semantics.

The *semantics first* approach argues for an inversion of this process on the
basis that it leads to more consistent and extensible languages. In the
semantics first approach, early effort is focused on organizing the target
domain into a compositional denotational semantics, then incrementally growing
a syntax on top of the semantic core.

The approach is partly inspired by the success of combinator-based DSLs in
Haskell, such as [Parsec](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parsec).
