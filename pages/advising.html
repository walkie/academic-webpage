<h2>Applying to Join Us</h2>
<p>
If you're interested in working with us, you should follow the standard process
for <a href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/future-graduate-students">applying to
the EECS graduate program at OSU</a>. However, please do also send me an email!
</p>
<p>
Note that I get a very high number of generic inquiries during grad school
application season, and I don't bother to respond to most of these. If you are
genuinely interested in working with my group, please clearly state <i>why</i> in
your email (e.g. you are interested in the work we are doing, or I was
recommended to you by someone). Consider that taking on a new student is a huge
investment of time and energy and there are many applicants for a small number
of positions, so you need to convince me that <i>you</i> are the one I should
accept.

<h2>Graduated Students</h2>

Here is a list of my past students. You can find their theses and project
