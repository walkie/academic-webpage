## Upcoming Course

**CS 609 Diskussionsseminar: Human Factors in Programming Languages**

Most programming language research is focused on formal qualities like type
safety and correctness, or else on machine-centric qualities like efficiency.
However, a programming language is ultimately intended to be used by a human.
The languages we use shape the way we approach, understand, and attempt to
solve problems. Good languages can not only help professional programmers be
more productive and solve harder problems, they can empower non-traditional
programmers by making computing more accessible.

In this seminar, we will focus on human aspects of programming language design.
We will discuss theories from cognitive science related to programming and how
these theories can be applied to improve the design of programming languages.
We will discuss human-centric language design methodologies and theoretical
frameworks for analyzing the usability of programming languages. Finally, we
will study the unique challenges of designing a language for the huge and
rapidly growing class of non-traditional, end-user programmers.

Each week we will meet to read and discuss one paper. One student will prepare
and lead the discussion. Other students must send discussion topics/questions
to the leader at least one day before our meeting. Our working language will be
English.
