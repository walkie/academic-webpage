# Research

My research is broadly focused on language design and domain-specific
languages. I believe that clear and expressive representations are essential
for understanding, solving, and explaining difficult problems. I am especially
interested in type systems, functional programming, visual languages, and in
designing languages for domain experts who may not be professional programmers.

## Choice Calculus

I am the co-creator of the [choice calculus][CC], a formal language that
supports theoretical work on the effective management of variation in software.
Using the choice calculus we have developed safe transformations, quality
criteria, and new abstraction techniques for variational programs. We have also
developed a notion of variational types and extended the Damas-Milner algorithm
to perform efficient type inference on variational lambda calculus.

## Explanation-Oriented Programming

I have also co-founded the paradigm of [explanation-oriented programming][XOP],
where programs produce explanations of their execution as a primary output and
languages are designed around the production of these explanations.

## Semantics-First Language Design

I have co-founded the [semantics first][SF] approach to language design, with
the goal of producing more principled and extensible languages. This is
achieved by inverting the usual language design process, beginning by
identifying and decomposing the semantics domain before considering the syntax
of the language.  This work was the basis for a class on designing DSLs taught
in Spring 2012 at Oregon State University.
