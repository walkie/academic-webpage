# Research

Programming languages are more than a means for creating programs.

The languages we use shape the way we view the world, formulate questions, and
ultimately solve problems. At their best, programming languages reveal the
underlying patterns among seemingly different problems; they help us tease
apart complexity and make the overwhelming manageable; and they support the
unambiguous sharing of ideas between people.

My research can be broadly organized into two categories:

 1. Design and application of domain-specific languages (DSLs).
 2. Foundational work on the principles and process of language design.

Naturally, work in each area area complements and informs the other. For
example, a useful research strategy is to explore language design issues
through the design of individual DSLs. Grounding foundational work in the
design of actual languages, provides a pragmatic way to addressing rather open
design questions and yields hopefully useful and interesting languages along
the way.


## Projects

 *  **[Choice Calculus](/projects/choice-calculus.html)** <br> A simple, formal
    language intended as the *lambda calculus of variation research*.
    
 *  **[Explanation-Oriented Programming](/projects/xop.html)** <br> A new
    programming paradigm focused around the construction of *explanations* as a
    primary program output.
 
 *  **[Semantics-First Language Design](/projects/semantics-first.html)** <br>
    An inversion of the typical language design process, intended to produce
    more principled and easily extensible languages.
 
 *  **[Hagl: Haskell Game Language](/projects/hagl.html)** <br> A DSL embedded in Haskell for
    *experimental game theory*.
