# Community Statement

## Establishing a positive community

Every student should feel safe and welcome to contribute in this course. As the
instructor, I will try to establish this tone whenever possible, but ultimately
the responsibility for cultivating a safe and welcoming community belongs to
the students---that means you!

Fortunately, being part of a safe and welcoming community is not too hard. A
good place to start is to recognize (and continually remind yourself) of the
following facts:

 * Your classmates come from a variety of cultural, economic, and educational
   backgrounds. Something that is obvious to you may not be obvious to them.
 * Your classmates are human beings with intelligence and emotions. This
   applies even when one or the other of you is posting anonymously on Piazza.
 * Your classmates are here to learn. They have the right to pursue their
   education without being distracted by others' disruptive behavior, or made
   uncomfortable by inappropriate jokes or unwanted sexual interest.

If each of us remembers these facts and act with corresponding decency,
respect, and professionalism, the course will certainly be better for everyone.

Some students might be inclined to shrug this off and perhaps crack a joke
about safe spaces or political correctness. If that's you, please also know
that if you make a fellow student uncomfortable by mocking them, making
inappropriate jokes, or making unwanted advances, that is *harassment* and will
be taken seriously. (If you are a victim of harassment, please see the brief
[list of resources](#resources) at the bottom of this page.)

However, I hope that we can all approach this positively. Treat your classmates
as respected colleagues, support each other when needed, have fun without
spoiling it for anyone else, and everybody wins.


## Zooming out: diversity and computer science

On a broader note, computer science suffers from a lack of diversity. This is a
problem for the field since we miss out on ideas, perspectives, and
contributions from underrepresented groups. It's a problem for society since
computer science jobs pay well and underrepresented groups correlate with
historically economically disadvantaged groups, reducing opportunity for upward
mobility. Part of this complicated problem is that underrepresented groups
leave computer science programs at a higher rate, and [evidence
shows][Retention] that this is a result of environmental conditions. I hope
that our efforts in this course can help to improve this situation, in some
small way, rather than make it worse.

Many open source projects, companies, and professional societies have
recognized that the lack of diversity amongst contributors is a problem since
they miss out on ideas, perspectives, and contributions from underrepresented
groups. To address this, they have established community guidelines and codes
of conduct to support communities that are more welcoming to new and diverse
contributors. Here are a few examples that I recommend reading:

 * [Contributor Covenant][Covenant]: a code of conduct shared by many open
   source projects, including Atom, Eclipse, Mono, Rails, Swift, and many more.
 * [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines][Mozilla]
 * [Python Diversity Statement][Python]
 * [Ubuntu Code of Conduct][Ubuntu]
 * [Apple Inclusion and Diversity Statement][Apple]
 * [Google Diversity Statement][Google]
 * [Microsoft Global Diversity and Inclusion Statement][Microsoft]
 * [ACM Code of Conduct][ACM]

Note that promoting diversity is also a [core value of Oregon State
University][OSU] and a [goal of the College of Engineering][COE].


## What to do about harassment {#resources}

If you are the victim of harassment in this class, there are several resources
available to you:

 * You may schedule a private meeting to talk to me.
 * You may contact the [University Ombuds Office][Ombud] for confidential
   guidance and advice.
 * You may contact the [Office of Equal Opportunity and Access][EOA] to file an
   informal or formal complaint.

You may also want to read OSU's policies on [bullying][Bullying] and on [sexual
harassment and misconduct][SexualHarassment].
