## Physics of Notation

### Design Principles

1. **Semiotic Clarity** - there should be a 1:1 correspondence between semantic
   constructs and graphical symbols.

2. **Perceptual Discriminability** - different symbols should be clearly
   distinguishable from each other.

3. **Semantic Transparency** - use visual representations whose appearance suggests
   their meaning.

4. **Complexity Management** - include explicit mechanisms for dealing with
   complexity.

5. **Cognitive Integration** - include explicit mechanisms to support integration
   of information from different diagrams.

6. **Visual Expressiveness** - use the full range and capacities of visual
   variables.

7. **Dual Coding** - use text to complement graphics.

8. **Graphic Economy** - the number of different graphical symbols should be
   cognitively manageable.

9. **Cognitive Fit** - use different visual dialects for different tasks and
   audiences.
