# Design Project - Human Factors in Programming Languages

In this phase of the seminar you will apply the knowledge you have gained
throughout the semester to a small design project. You will design a language
or tool that enables a specific user to perform some specific programming tasks
that would be difficult or impossible for them to accomplish otherwise. You
will use at least two of the intellectual tools we have discussed this semester
during the design process.


## Deliverables

 * **Jan 14** --- Send to me by email a very brief (~1 paragraph) written
   proposal of your design project, including your user, and the tasks they
   would like to perform. You should also state the design tools you plan to
   use and why.

 * **Feb 3** or **Feb 10** --- Give a 15 minute presentation on your design in
   our seminar meeting. After each presentation we will have approximately 15
   minutes of discussion, where you will need to respond to questions and
   possibly defend your design.

 * **Feb 17** --- Submit a short written document providing the rationale for
   your design decisions in terms of the chosen intellectual tools, and your
   experience applying the tools.


## Details

 * Your user should be a single, *specific* person that you have personal
   access to. He or she may be either a programmer or non-programmer. The
   motivation for picking a single user is to focus the design in the spirit of
   [situated software](http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html). 

 * The tasks your user wants to perform should be related to some aspect of
   software development. It need not be creating new software---testing,
   debugging, and understanding existing software are also acceptable tasks.
   It also need not be about traditional software development---recall our
   discussion of Blackwell's relatively broad definition of programming at the
   beginning of the semester.
 
 * The tasks should be specific enough to focus the design but general enough
   that the investment in designing and learning a new language or tool can be
   repaid in saved attention and effort.

 * You should choose one of the frameworks/strategies we discussed this semester
   (Attention Investment, Cognitive Dimensions, Surprise-Explain-Reward, etc.)
   as your *primary design tool*, and use this to inform your design decisions.

 * You should choose one or more other intellectual tools as *secondary design
   tools*, to supplement your primary design tool. Take special note of any
   interesting interactions between your primary and secondary design tools.

 * Your presentation should (1) introduce your user and his or her tasks, (2)
   note the intellectual tools you applied to this design problem, (3) provide
   an overview of the design, (4) walk us through a few specific use cases. You
   should focus especially on how your chosen design tools influenced the
   design, where they were helpful, where they weren't, and where they
   interacted with each other.

 * The written document you submit should briefly summarize the main points of
   your presentation. Once again, it should focus on motivating your design
   decisions in terms of the design tools, and your experience using the design
   tools. No more than two pages, and less is fine. I recommend some bulleted
   lists. :-)
