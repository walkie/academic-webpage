title: List of Research Projects

  * I have co-founded the *semantics first* approach to language design, with
    the goal of producing more principled and extensible languages.
    
  * I have co-founded the paradigm of [*explanation-oriented programming*][XOP], where
    programs produce explanations of their execution as a primary output and
    languages are designed around the production of these explanations.

  * I have designed DSLs for explaining and executing strategies in
    [experimental game theory][Hagl], supporting philosophical research on
    causation, and explaining probabilistic reasoning.

  * I am especially interested in future collaborations in the areas of game
    design, bioninformatics, and linguistics.
