With [Keeley Abbott](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~abbottk/) and [Chris
Bogart](http://quetzal.bogarthome.net/), our paper "Programs for People: What
we can Learn from Lab Protocols"
([PDF](papers/vlhcc15-programs-for-people.pdf)) has been accepted to
[VL/HCC 2015](https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2015/). This paper analyzes
lab protocols as programs for human execution in order to identify design
principles for mixed-initiative programming.
