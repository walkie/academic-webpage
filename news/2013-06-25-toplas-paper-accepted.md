title: Variational Type Inference paper accepted to TOPLAS
---

With Sheng Chen and Martin Erwig, our paper "Extending Type Inference to
Variational Programs" ([PDF](papers/toplas14-variational-typing.pdf))
was accepted to the [*ACM Transactions on Programming
Languages and Systems*][TOPLAS]. This is a great result for a paper with many
years of work behind it. In addition to the main contribution, it demonstrates
the applicability of the choice calculus and its potential for theory reuse.
