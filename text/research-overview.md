title: Research Overview
---

My research is broadly focused on *language design* and *domain-specific
languages*. I believe that clear and expressive languages are essential for
understanding, solving, and explaining difficult problems. I am especially
interested in type systems, [functional programming][Haskell], visual
languages, and in designing languages for domain experts who may not be
professional programmers.

Currently, I am researching formal representations and analyses of *variation*.
This research is motived by improving the development and maintenance of
massively configurable software, such as [software product lines][SPL] and the
Linux kernel. I am the co-creator of the [*choice calculus*][CC], a simple
calculus of variation that can be easily extended with new features and
instantiated by new object languages.
