title: Research Overview
---

My research is broadly focused on *language design* and *domain-specific
languages*. I believe that clear and expressive representations are essential
for understanding, solving, and explaining difficult problems. I am especially
interested in type systems, [functional programming][Haskell], visual
languages, and in designing languages for domain experts who may not be
professional programmers.

  * I am the co-creator of the [*choice calculus*][CC], a formal language that
    supports research on managing and analyzing variation in software.

  * I have co-founded the *semantics first* approach to language design, with
    the goal of producing more principled and extensible languages.
    
  * I have co-founded the paradigm of *explanation-oriented programming*, where
    programs produce explanations of their execution as a primary output and
    languages are designed around the production of these explanations.

  * I have designed DSLs for explaining and executing strategies in
    [experimental game theory][Hagl], supporting philosophical research on
    causation, and explaining probabilistic reasoning.

  * I am especially interested in future collaborations in the areas of game
    design, bioninformatics, and linguistics.
