Variation is a commonly encountered element of modern software systems. Recent
research into variation has led to increasing interest in the development of
variational programming languages and corresponding variational models of
execution. Variational imperative languages pose a particular challenge due to
the complex interactions between side effects and variation. The development of
interpreters for variational imperative languages has produced a number of
techniques to address these interactions. This thesis builds upon and
formalizes these techniques by defining a formal operational semantics for a
simple imperative language that supports both variation and common side
effects. We also provide an example of the successful implementation of these
techniques in the form of the Resource DSL. One area in which variation is
frequently encountered is in defining configurations and resource requirements
for the deployment of modern software systems. To this end, we have developed
the Resource DSL, a language that aids in the specification of resource
requirements for highly configurable software systems.
