As a general solution to the problem of managing structural and content
variability in relational databases, in previous work we have introduced the
Variational Database Management System (VDBMS). VDBMS consists of a
representation of a variational database (VDB) and a corresponding typed query
language (v-query). However, since this is a novel database representation,
there are no existing instances of VDBs or v-queries that can be used to
evaluate the VDBMS. In this project, we present two case studies to demonstrate
the use of VDBMS and support its evaluation. The case studies were constructed
by systematically encoding variability scenarios from prior work and generating
corresponding VDBs by adapting existing widely-used data sets. The first case
study shows how to use the VDBMS to manage database variants under a schema
evolution scenario. The second case study demonstrates how to integrate the
VDBMS with a database-backed software product line. Each case study provides a
VDB and a set of v-queries that will be used to evaluate the VDBMS.
Additionally, we provide some insights into generating VDBs from relational
databases that could assist future VDBMS users.
