In this thesis, we present semantic equivalence rules for an extension of the
choice calculus and sound operations for an implementation of variational
lists. The choice calculus is a calculus for describing variation and the
formula choice calculus is an extension with formulas. We prove semantic
equivalence rules for the formula choice calculus. Variational lists are
functional data structures for representing and computing with variation in
lists using the choice calculus. We prove map and bind operations are sound for
an implementation of variational lists. These proofs are written and verified
in the language of the Coq proof assistant.
