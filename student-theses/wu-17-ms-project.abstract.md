CoprHD is an open source software-defined storage and API platform which
creates an abstraction layer over multi-vendor heterogeneous storage systems.
It offers the ability to discover, pool and automate the management of the
storage ecosystem with the help of storage drivers establishing connections
between CoprHD and storage systems. On the demand of attracting more attentions
from third-party storage companies, CoprHD community proposed a southbound
driver SDK to simplify the process of developing a storage driver for CoprHD.
ScaleIO storage driver, being the first one based on this southbound SDK, is
implemented by us with Intel and EMC to serve the purposes to verify the
southbound SDK and explore an effective way for the third-party driver
development. This ScaleIO storage driver also acts as a template driver for the
CoprHD community.
