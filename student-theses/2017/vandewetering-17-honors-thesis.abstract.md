This paper discusses the merits of providing users variational views when
editing variational code. I provide a plugin for the popular Atom Integrated
Development Environment (IDE) which replaces \#ifdef annotations commonly used
by the C PreProcessor (CPP) with colored backgrounds, thus reducing code
clutter and attempting to help programmers quickly distinguish code that
belongs to different features. I also provide a number of helpful features
designed to help the programmer create, remove, and refactor feature code.
Finally, I present a user study conducted in order to determine how helpful
each of the two main features (code folding and background color) are to
programmers -- it was determined that while there were no significant
differences in efficiency or accuracy, the user experience was considerably
enhanced.
