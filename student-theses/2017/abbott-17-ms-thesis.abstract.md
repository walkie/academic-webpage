Mixed-initiative programming entails collaboration between a computer system,
and a human to achieve some desired goal or set of goals. Often these goals
change or are amended in real time during the course of program execution. As
such, the plans these programs are based on must adapt and evolve to
accommodate this iterative process. This thesis collects a literature review of
research done in the field of mixed-initiative programs that provides an
understanding of the problems faced when attempting to integrate computer
systems and human users, a previously published paper with formative work in
understanding how humans write programs for other humans, and finally some
initial work done to develop an embedded domain-specific language for
mixed-initiative drone control.
